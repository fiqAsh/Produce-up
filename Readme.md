Project Name : Produce Up

Synopsis: This Project focuses on solving the problem of price discrepancies in fresh Produce in our country. We often see that produce that is low in price in rural areas has four to five times the price in cities. A centralized system can lower this cost by relative margin and make it affordable to customers. So in this project we will focus on making a system that will let customers know how much produce is around them and also a delivery system that will deliver produce nearby the users.
